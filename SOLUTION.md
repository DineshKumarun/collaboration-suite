# GUI Application Fix - Solution Summary

## Problem
The GUI application was hanging indefinitely and not displaying the main window after successful login.

## Root Cause
The issue was with the `scrolledtext.ScrolledText` widget creation. When created with `state=tk.DISABLED`, it was causing tkinter to hang/freeze during initialization.

## Solution Applied
Replaced `scrolledtext.ScrolledText` with a manual implementation using:
- `tk.Text` widget for the chat display
- `tk.Scrollbar` for scrolling functionality
- Proper linking between the two widgets

This resolved the hang and the application now starts successfully.

## Current Status
✅ Login dialog works perfectly
✅ Main application window displays successfully  
✅ All GUI elements are created
✅ Application enters mainloop and is ready for user interaction

## Next Steps for User
1. The application is now working
2. You can interact with the GUI (Join Session button, etc.)
3. Some ALSA audio warnings appear but are non-critical
4. To suppress audio warnings, you can set environment variable: `PYAUDIO_SUPPRESS_WARNINGS=1`

## Technical Details
- Changed from: `scrolledtext.ScrolledText` widget
- Changed to: Manual `tk.Text` + `tk.Scrollbar` combination
- File modified: `gui_client.py` (chat section in `_create_gui` method)
